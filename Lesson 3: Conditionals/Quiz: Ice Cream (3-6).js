 * Write a single if statement that logs out the message:
 *
 * "I'd like two scoops of __________ ice cream in a __________ with __________."

 * ...only if:
 *   - flavor is "vanilla" or "chocolate"
 *   - vessel is "cone" or "bowl"
 *   - toppings is "sprinkles" or "peanuts"
 *
 * We're only testing the if statement and your boolean operators.
 * It's okay if the output string doesn't match exactly.
